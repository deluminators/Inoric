# Fedole  
A Feature rich mobile application aimed to simplify college functioning
even in the times of a global pandemic.

### Idea  
On brainstorming on the given problem statement on providing solutions aimed at retaining the quality
of content delivery and proper functioning of any institute imparting higher education, we researched
upon the points where such institutes may lack the norms specified for reducing the risk of spread of
any communicable disease like the global pandemic COVID19, which resulted in figuring out the points
such as students visiting the classroom lectures, laboratory exercises, examinations, canteens, library,
nearby shops especially for students in a residential institution where on any usual day a large number
of crowd is visible due to which it makes the spread of such diseases to increase rapidly and making
the trace of the contact very difficult because of such large gatherings altogether with an uncertain
chaos. Thus, we present a user-friendly feature riched mobile application called Fedole which aims at
providing solutions for carrying out all the functions in a usual institute with increased chances of
maintaining specific norms of social distancing and hygiene.  
  
    
### Solution
Under the mobile application (we plan to provide a mobile application first because of its simpler and
varied usage bur design of a web application can also be made.), we plan to integrate the following
modules thus making it a feature rich application to be used by everyone to continue imparting and
receiving education at ease.     
   
    Module 1: Visual Lectures & Laboratories: ​ With the usage of modern technologies like AR/VR we plan
    to build a visually rich framework where classroom lectures as well as laboratory exercises can be
    recorded, shared as well as viewed both in live and recorded formats which will thus help the students
    to view those in almost real life view even when used remotely, thus gain practical knowledge yet not
    visiting class when sought extreme necessary.
     
    Module 2: Smart exams: ​ We also plan to integrate a testing module which will be made using
    advanced security features which uses modern ML methods to prevent malpractices and yet aims to
    provide multiple methods to examine the understanding of the students and for conducting major
    academic examinations, we thus plan to make multiple methods fro carrying out the examinations in
    forms of both written and viva mode. In integrating both these feature, we will also build an academic
    check module to be used to keep a check and track of the performance and progress of the student. In
    view of this, we will also prepare a Faulty’s application to be used in creating the required lecture
    content and examination material.  
   
    Module 3: Find my way!: ​ In modern major universities having huge campuses where a huge number
    of students are enrolled every year, it is very difficult to maintain social distancing among every person,
    especially when someone wants to visit any place where they are uncertain about the crowds already
    present at any certain location or might be present later. Thus we aim to develop a route prediction
    using modern algorithms which will help to find the best route in travelling from one location to another
    and that too with the minimum amount of crowd and traffic possible. The process works in two ways,
    firstly live data collection where information about crowds will be extracted by people already present
    in the route having the application whose GPS data(for smart phones) and GPRS data (for feature
    phones) will be used to find aggregate crowd at certain locations in the campus and with this data
    being stored everyday, we can also analyse the timings at different locations where the usual crowds
    can be present and thus using all this aggregated data, we can predict a route with minimum crowd
    which will surely help the students, faculty and every member of the institution to find the best and
    shortest route possible with the least amount of crowd thus to maintain social distancing.
     
     Module 4: Hear me!: ​ In modern colleges and universities we often require to use services which
     require touch to be used such as buttons in lift etc. which are a potential transmitters of such
     communicable diseases, thus we aim to create modules using interconnected IOT devices to be used
     to limit this touch using automatic voice and gesture commands wherever they will be needed. On
     some research of the planned technology, we found that the hardware technology to be used can be
     implemented in a very cost effective way and thus may help us in reducing the usage of sense of touch
     in various places where it is used thus restricting a fairly potential transmission channel.
     
     Module 5: Help me Pal ! : ​ In an attempt to reduce many unnecessary travelling and thus avoiding
     having contact with people, we aim in making an avail and chain concept which might help in
     reducing many unnecessary crowds. For explaining the module properly, we would like to provide
     examples in support, lets say a student is in need of any particular book from library and before
     visiting the library he just puts a request in the application for searching any other person in their
     vicinity who had already subscribed to that book from the library, and then on putting a request to
     either share or hand over the book, the library authorities and both the students are informed about
     the same, and thus the subscription information of the book is transferred from one to another without
     even visiting the library by any single person, thus avoiding many unnecessary travel, secondly,
     suppose any student has to pickup any delivery which is waiting at any location say the institute gates,
     before visiting the location if he puts a request to the application to check whether someone is
     already in the location before to receive the delivery on his behalf and then just forward the item. In
     doing this we can also employ a reward system for people transferring the product and a chain system
     which might help when direct contact or transfer cannot be made when it can be made in partitions
     where one person giving the commodity to one and the chain continues according to the feasibilityuntil the thing reaches the person who
     initially requested.



### Prerequisites

As long as you have a pc, with an emulator installed to it, with node, npm and expo running, you are good to go!

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Go to the root directory of the app, then run

```
npm install
```
```
npm start
```

An expo server will start on the browser, You can run on android device/emulator or can scan the qr code with expo android app.
